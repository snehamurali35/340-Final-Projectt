## # You must persuasively establish the existing need that your app addresses.

You can do this in several ways:
By gathering and synthesizing existing evidence (e.g. from prior research, news stories, etc.) to make a persuasive argument for the existence of a problem that your app will help with.
By conducting interviews with people who are among the population your app is meant to be helpful for. For example, if your app is intended to help people with a specific disability, you should interview people with that disability to understand their needs. Your evaluation must also include them.
By critiquing an existing app that addresses the need, and describing how the app could be improved.

Whichever route you choose, you should describe your approach, evidence, etc. in a file called docs/need.md.

    Our app is a migraine logger app, that allows a user to create entries that track and record the severity of a migraine that the user has, view statistics about the users migraines and steps, through a connection to the health API, and finally, displays a calendar view of the user's migraines. One of our group members, Ally Tribble, suffers from migraines frequently, and found that the app she used, Migraine Buddy, to track her migraines asked for a lot of excessive information that made it cumbersome to even log a migraine. Migraines are so painful to start with, and so it makes it incredibly hard to look at your phone for such a long period of time.

    Our app has just enough information to properly keep track of a migraine, without the hassle of entering such a large amount of information every time. In addition, our app allows for a user to view stats on the frequency of their migraine, and the time they usually occur, which is helpful to learn the times that they are most prevalent. Thus, our app is meant to help those who struggle with logging their migraines, and help them better prepare for future migraine episodes by displaying stats about their past migraines, a calendar view of their migraines, and finally allowing people to make a migraine new log entry.
